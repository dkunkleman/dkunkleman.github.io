Like Charlie Network — Launch Kit (Static Site)
==============================================

1) Deploy
   - Drag this folder into Netlify *or* push to a GitHub repo and enable GitHub Pages.
   - Your main page is: index.html

2) Personalize
   - Replace images in /assets with your final badge art.
   - Open index.html and update any copy or links.
   - Keep the disclaimer to remain friendly with CharlieChallenge.org/TPUSA.

3) Start Counting
   - The “Submit story” form saves a CSV locally for now (no backend required).
   - Create a Google Form or Airtable with fields: handle, state, group, badge, link, ref, notes.
   - Replace the form with your embed, and power leaderboards from that sheet.

4) First Post
   - Use the caption in the “Launch caption” section.
   - Add a badge overlay from assets/badge_pack.zip (square or story).

5) Donation Proofs
   - See assets/receipt_redaction_checklist.png
   - Overlays: receipt_verified_stamp.png and donation_confirmed_banner.png

Questions? You’re ready to post Day One. Add features (leaderboards, kits, merch) as momentum grows.
